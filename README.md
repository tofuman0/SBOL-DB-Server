# Shutokou Battle Online Database Server
A Japanese only Online multiplayer Tokyo Xtreme Racer game was shutdown around 2005. With no packet logs or any documentation of how the game worked<br/><br/>

Excuse the mess. Anyone willing to help on the project let me know.<br/><br/>

Check out the [Wiki](http://wiki.sb-online.net) for packet documentation and the [Blog](http://sb-online.net/blog/) for any progress updates.
